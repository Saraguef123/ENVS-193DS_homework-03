# Problem 1: Personal data

## a.) Data Summarizing 
I would summarize my data by looking at the mean time I spend on school work for each day of the week. The response variable is the time spent on school work and the predictor variable is day of week. Comparing the mean between these groups is informative because I could be outside more  on some days of the week more than others and this can affect the amount of time I spend on school work each day of the week.

## b.) Visualization
```{r}
mydata$day.of.week <-  factor(mydata$day.of.week, #converts day of week to a factor with specific order
                             levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday",
                                        "Sunday")) 


mean_data <- mydata |> #uses my_data frame
group_by(day.of.week) |> #groups points by day of week
  summarize(mean_time = mean(Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min.)) #calculates mean time spent on school work for each day of the week
  
ggplot(mydata, #uses mydata frame
       aes(x = day.of.week, #x-axis should be day of week
           y = Time.spent.on.Schoolwork.min., #y-axis should be time spent on school work in min
                   color = day.of.week)) + #coloring geometries by day of week
  
  geom_jitter( width =0.1, #adds points
               height= 0,
               alpha=0.5)+ # points 50% transparent
  geom_point(data=mean_data, aes(y=mean_time), shape = 16, size = 3, color = "red")+#adds a mean point for each day
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Monday" = "magenta", #changes color of points
    "Tuesday" = "orange", #changes color of points 
    "Wednesday" = "gold", #changes color of points
    "Thursday" = "green", #changes color of points
    "Friday" = "darkblue",#changes color of points
    "Saturday"= "black",  #changes color of points
    "Sunday" = "turquoise"  #changes color of points
  ))+
  labs(
    title = " Average Time Spent on School Work by Day of Week", #adds a title
    x = "Day of the Week", #changes x-axis title
    color = "Day of Week", #changes legend title
    y = "Time spent on School Work(min)", #changes y-axis title
    caption = "Figure 1") +#adds a caption 
  theme_bw() #changing theme of plot

```

## c. Caption
Figure 1: Average time spent on school work(min) measured each day of the week Sunday-Friday.Small circles represent the individual observations for time spent on school work each day. The red point represents the mean time spent on school work for each week day.

## d. Table presentation
```{r}
personaldata_table <- mean_data |> # using  mean_data frame
select(day.of.week,mean_time) |> #uses selected columns
gt() |> #creates table
tab_header(
title = "Summary Statistics on Average Time Spent on School Work by day of week") |>#creates title
cols_label( # changes columns names
  day.of.week = "Day of Week",
mean_time = "Mean(min)") |> # changes column name
fmt_number( #formats numbers correctly
columns = where(is.numeric), #rounds each column where a number is to one decimal place.
decimals = 1)
personaldata_table # returns table

```

# Problem 2. Affective visualization

## a. Describing affective visualization
I am comparing the mean time spent on school work each day. What an affective visualization could like for this is drawing 7 circles representing the mean time spent on school. I then would label each circle by day of week. I then would color in each circle red, With the darkest shade being the day with the highest average of time spent on school work and lightest shade of red being the smallest average time spent on school work

## b.Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea.

## c.

## d.
This piece is showing the average time I spend on school work each day of the week represented in circular shapes. Each circle represents the mean time spent on school work for that day of the week. The shade of red indicates the average amount of time where the darkest shade is the highest average compared to the other days of the week. The lightest shade of red represent the lowest average. I got inspiration from the environmental graphiti gallery website.(https://www.environmentalgraphiti.org/series-folder) by looking at the different ways data can be visualized. This piece was created using the notability app and utilizing the tools they have. The process for this piece took a couple of days. I took a day trying to think of ideas and sketches. The last day was for drawing this piece and making sure the shade of red was different for each day depending on the averages.


# Problem 3. Statistical critique

## a.  Revisit and summarize
One of the statistical tests included in this paper is a Kruskal Wallis test. The predictor
variable was the Location and the response variable was the mp concentration in water
and sediment samples form the 3 locations in the river. No table or figure was provided for this specific test however a description of the results is provided.

![](../media/Original.png)

## b. Visual Clarity
![](../media/Table.png)

The authors don't provide a figure/table for the specific Kruskal Wallis test above. However one other Kruskal Wallis test the authors run  is on the source pond type and how this affects mp concentrations in water and sediment. The predictor variable is the source pond type being saltwater and a mixture of saltwater and river water. The response variable is mp concentration in both water and sediment. The table provided is missing some components to  clearly represent the data underlying the test. It accurately provides the p-value however the ranking(H value) of the Kruskal Wallis test is not provided and this would be important to provide because the main part for a Kruskal Wallis test is comparing the ranks between groups and a H value would tell us the magnitude of the difference between groups.


## c. Aesthetic clarity
The authors could have included in the table some horizontal lines separating the different groups of water and sediment. This would make it more organized and less cluttered. In addition they could have organized the data and have a column named Kruskal Wallis instead of repeating it twice for each group. Lastly, having column names for the sample types would look more organized than having a long title explaining the different samples in parenthesis.


## d. Recommendations
Some recommendations I have for the table would be to organize and format it more neatly. For example having the Kruskal Wallis test mentioned not twice in the table but rather a column name. I would also recommend to add more than just the p-value from the test. Since the author is running a Kruskal Wallis test, they should add the H value or the result from the test to the data. In addition the degrees of freedom should be mentioned because we want to know how many groups were compared statistically speaking instead of saying which groups were being compared in the long description.
